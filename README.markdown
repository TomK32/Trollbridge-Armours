Itâ€™s Dangerous to go Alone! Take this!
======================================

From the classic adventure game this line was chosen theme for the Ludum Dare 20.
The decisive moment where the hero is given his weapon and sent on an epic quest.
But what happend before that, how often does it happen and what profit was in for
the blacksmith? Questions this game will answer.

Join the booming weapon industry and manufacture everyone's favourite battle gear.
From woodden swords to legendary swords, from shields fitting this odd round hole
in you shop door to siege towers. Everything can be sold and everyone's a customer.
