Trollbridge Armours
-------------------

Itâ€™s Dangerous to go Alone! Take this!
======================================

From a classic high fantasy action-adventure video game this line was chosen as
theme for the Ludum Dare 20 in April/March 2011 and Trollbrige Armour is my entry.
It's the decisive moment, the hero being given his weapon and sent on an epic quest.
But what happend before that, how often does it happen and what profit was in for
the blacksmith? Questions this game will answer.

Join the booming weapon industry and manufacture everyone's favourite battle gear.
From woodden swords to legendary swords, from shields fitting this odd round hole
in you shop door to siege towers. Everything can be sold and everyone's a customer.

Running the tests
