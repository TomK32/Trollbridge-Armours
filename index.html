        Welcome player, this is <strong>Trollbridge Armours</strong> the company that you
        have inherited from you uncle Frank Abercombe who died in Lagos last year.
        I'm sorry that it took so long to find you.
        His workshop has manufactured and sold weapons and armours to all kinds
        of heroes and villains but as your uncle's health went bad the business went down as well.
      </p><p>
        Your uncle's old staff has left after his death and a year later the workshop
        will require you to start at zero. There's not much money left as the search for you
        was very expensive but there's some <em>material in the inventory</em> left and also many
        <em>manuscripts</em> that will allow you to start the business and gain new customers.
      </p>
